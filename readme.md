# Advent of code 2022

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 event: https://adventofcode.com/

I don't have any particular aims or objectives with these solutions, I find it's a 'fun' self-contained exercise in solving interesting algorithmic problems in a festive setting.

At the time of writing (3rd January 2023) I am missing 4 stars and the bonus star for the puzzle on the 25th. I can see how to solve for the stars I am missing, but the question becomes more around how much time I want to put in to this set of puzzles.

We shall see!
